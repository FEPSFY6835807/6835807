            Koenigsegg is a car company which produces hypercars and I will be showing you the phenomenon behind one of their cars.

           The marvellous minds behind the Koenigsegg one:1 are none other Christian Von Koenigsegg and his team. The Koenigsegg one:1 is the only car with the horsepower to curb weight ratio in kilograms being a ratio of 1:1. This is a remarkable feat of engineering as everything from the engine and suspension to the exhaust has to be considered carefully as everything will contribute to the weight. As well as matching the ratio to 1:1 Koenigsegg also had to make sure this car had raised the performance bar in the world of hyper cars, which Koenigsegg has a formidable reputation.
           
            How does the ratio of curb weight to horsepower affect the actual experience of driving the car? 

As stated by himself it makes the car “nimble” and “how easily accessible the power is”. He also mentioned that the steering and brakes as well as the chassis was focussed on as well and that the team was also looking to improve the overall experience of driving the car as well as the power output. 
So inconclusion the One:1 can be seen as one of the most impressive engineering feats in terms of the hypercar industry so far.
